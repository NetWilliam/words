<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><span lang="en-US"><b>BENE</b>
- is Latin for “well.” A benefit is a good result or effect.
Something beneficial produces good results or effects. The Latin root
can be heard in other languages as well: “Good!” or “Fine!”
in Spanish is “Bueno!”; in French, it’s “Bon!”; and in
Italian, just say “Bene!”<br/>

that wasn’t certain but might be “provable.”<br/>

Latin words meaning “heavy, weighty, seriaous.” Gravity is, of
course, what makes things heavy, and without it there wouldn’t be
any life on earth, since nothing would stay on earth at all. This
